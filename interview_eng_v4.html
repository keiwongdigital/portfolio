My name is K. Wong. I am visual-focused freelance designer for up to 3 years now.<br><br>

<!--I graduated with a Multimedia, High Diploma at IVE.<br><br>

Throughout my career, I have noticed that I am good at creating something from scratch, which keeps my life passionate.<br><br>-->

My previous experience is relevant to this role; I was a senior web designer at Tag Digital where I focused on UI design for four years. My responsibilites included,  web design, app design, digital assets, and assisting with various projects from concept to completion bringing the products to life. In addition to UI design, I have some experience in HTML, CSS and animation.<br><br>

During my time here, I redesigned Universal Music Group's website which reduce user bounce rates by 48%, successfully achieving the client's goals.<br><br>

Although my UX experience is lacking, I can contribute the UX skills I have learnt and engage in problem solving to challenge myself. I believe I can do more than my last role..<br><br>

Moving forward, I hope to expand my experience through challenging projects, where I can grow with your company.<br><br>

Thank you for your listening
