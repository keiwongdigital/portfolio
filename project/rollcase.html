      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title spacing-small">Research</p>
      <p class="observable body">The first thing to do is to get to know the users through data. We started researches to better understand the goal and user needs. We have interviewed 13 peoples from facebook who use physcial card and card app on a daily bases. Each with their frustration and the way of use. Here are the common issues faced:</p>
    </div>


    <div class="copy-width spacing-medium observable">
      <p class="observable body">Physical card users :</p>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="observable body spacing-medium">11/13 of interviewees said still use phyiscal card. They have been in business a long time already, and store sizable stash of business cards that need to get organized. They feel impatient and extra work.</p>


        <p class="observable body ">Digital card app users :</p>
        <ul class="observable body spacing-small">
          <li>User-unfriendly
            <br>-- "I use app recently but I dislike complex step when i import the card" --

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Key Insight</p>
      <p class="observable spacing-title">#1 How they currently business card management</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Organizing the business cards after meeting is major pain point of the both user digital and physical card, but always have been hassle work, The truth is, no one has the spend time to organize contacts and manually save business card details to their mobile or put into cardcase. In terms of the useability, They complained that the process feels complex and long. Additionally, in-app features not fufill users request currently during the real-life needs also.</p>

      <p class="observable spacing-title">#2 Their dont worries impact of card lossing</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-medium">We discovered a huge user still use the physical card today are most importantly. People can not make a business card instantly if someone’s information changed they had to order an entirely new stack of business cards. There's additional environmental waste when the people lose the card and production of the card also.</p>

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title spacing-medium">Competitive Analysis</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-copy">We began by doing some research to see what’s out there currently. I noted down the popular platforms, identified the key features I ideated rollcase to have, and reassessed the existing platforms based on those features.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-copy">The majority of the features between competitiors were very similar, however the main differences that we noticed were:</p>

      <ul class="observable body spacing-small">
          <li class="txtpoint spacing-copy">Easily accessible -vs- Hardly accessible</li>

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Emphasize task flow and Feedback</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">I reviewed necessary features and focused on interaction that needed improvement. I draft three sets of wireflow mocks that are essential to the concept: 1. Dashboard, 2. Create Own Card and 3. Scan Card. I tested with two participants that to identity their preferences for accessibly and understandable when perfrom 3 task:</p>

      <div class="copy-width observable spacing-small">
        <img class="spacing-small observable lazy" data-src="../images/projects/rollcase/draft_create.jpg" />
      </div>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">In terms of the create own card experience, participants to accomplish basic tasks the first time, I observe that the customizable option was most used from participants than build-in template, because new flow able to lead them for further action easily. Participants said completion step a bit longer,  So, I fixed that step from four step to three and some interaction issues.</p>

      <div class="copy-width observable spacing-small">
        <img class="spacing-small observable lazy" data-src="../images/projects/rollcase/draft_scan.jpg" />
      </div>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">In terms of the scan card processing, Above is another example; testing showed users were unsure whether the correct part of the card shot was selected and edit after; Following its implementation, however, users were overlooking and missing the contact data beneath it. In the high-fidelity version, a card preview was added accordingly. So the card preview became more clearly for thier editing if data extract not correctly.</p>

      <div class="copy-width observable spacing-small">
        <img class="spacing-small observable lazy" data-src="../images/projects/rollcase/draft_dashboard.jpg" />

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">In terms of the Dashboard experience, Here, I plan to give the digital card overview more visual impact. Lucky, They love the card list vertical scrolling feel cool. Perhaps, heightens the motivation and anticipation for users using the app. In further to stand out digital card section, remove describe of icon in mid filter bar shown icon symbol only.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-large">After a few rounds of hand drafts iterating, A/B testing to compare which is effective with user. Revised step-based framework is much cleaner and more straightforward. which longer step process pulled in where necessary.</p>

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Hi-Fi Wireframe</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">In order to more understanding, I utilized huge set of icon can help users navigate and operate clearly.
