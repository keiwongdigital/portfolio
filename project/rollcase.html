Receiving a physical business card is it can be easy to lose, The truth is, no one has the time to organize contacts and manually save business card details to their mobile. Also, we can not make a business card instantly.</p>

    <div class="copy-width spacing-medium">
      <p class="observable h3 spacing-title spacing-small"><b>Research</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">At the initial phase, I started quick researches to better understand the goal and user needs. We have interviewed 11 peoples who use physcial card and card app on a daily bases. Each with their pain point and the way of organize.<br><br>Here are the common issues faced:<br>→ <b>"Easy to lose / Always keep cards in my suits pocket"</b><br>→ <b>"Lack of time to organize / Sometimes I forget."</b><br>→<b> "if i just moved office or changed something? re-print card?"</b><br>→<b> "Exsiting card app UI ugly visual / Some process not clearly"</b></p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-medium">To better understand not only our end-to-end users, I researched other cards app their service structure, target users, and app/web product what problems exist. Through both of researches, we are clarified things that make up the core of the product that will appeal to the main target group.</p>

      <p class="observable body">After I got the revisions with teamates. I sketch out my ideas to better visualize the solution. After that, I started with wireframes phase, we focused on how to design a service that is more simple and intuitive experience. In the users persona part, the most need of the easier to use and more understandable interface. So, I tested the wireframes with 3 interviewees to understand which they preferred, extracting information, and visual appeal. This guided how I designed the rest of the experience. Here are prototyping screens, states and internal interection of core features.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">I decided three keywords for rollCase entire visual apperenance of the app: <b>Realistic, Stylish and Professional</b>.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">The app is image-driven including a lot of digital cards and users avatars. Use dark background makes the digital cards visuals deeper and makes the content highly legible with the orange accent color. To improve user experience, usage huge set of icon can help users navigate and operate the app clearly and quickly. In the type color, I used white for the text and and included a great deal of grey description to give a calm and clean appearance.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Additionally, I hope take that for a good balance of usability and visual appeal. Design approaches varous engaging illustration elements to keep it fun while working.</p>

The Bottom of navigation bars as core feature section, used frosted glass effect that incorporating static card and dynamic visuals, when scrolling where card are still blurred behind another, its more catchy.
