Each step take a time gap to learn about it, and need some patience to get task done that cause paper card users create barriers to entry and frustration, and also reflect current user unable to get motivate to use it, which means the user will back to use paper card if doesn't fullfill real-life situation, because the app itself unfriendly.</b></p>

        <p class="observable h6 spacing-title"><b>How do they currently organize thier business card?</b></p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-medium">The truth is, most people haven't spend time to organize bussiness card immediately, and manually save business card details to their mobile or put into cardcase. It's sometimes easy to forget or lose it. They often waste time on card finding if they contact with someone.</p>

        <p class="observable h6 spacing-title"><b>Digital card app not common</b></p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Across those research before, with 2/10 interviewees experience in app, but they were also simultaneously feels hard to use and feel vague to some users, so they dropping off. They unable to achieve the goal during the stuck task flow. Users focus on how helpful in real-life will interested in app use. <!-- This opens rooms for development for digital card app for potential markert.--></p>

        <p class="observable h6 spacing-title"><b>They don't worried about the environmental pollution issue</b></p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-large">In fact, There was a human-facing issue not only app usage or not so. A lot of card ending up in the trash whenever organzie thier business card. Also, paper card user can not make a business card instantly if information changed they had to order an entirely new stack of business cards. There's also extra pollution whenever the people reprint or lose the card. In other words, fit is more important for paper card users than for current app user with ones.</p>

So, the first focus was nailing user flow and making it as simple and obvious as possible.</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-sub-title">Aim to visually-fouced flow that helps for lessening users cognitive load and reduce time gap between step flow. To do so, the users can focus on their tasks completion intuitively. It also helps to heightens the motivation of both user types so that fits real-life usage.</p>

        <p class="observable h1 spacing-sub-title">Takeaway</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-sub-title">Being the limited resources as only UX/UI designer on the project. This app is special to me because it was first own UX project, which opened my eyes to the possibilities of using UX mindset as a solution, and in the real world there are many more things to consider and validate that i believe.<!--Although without in-depth UX process that further research for validation. --></p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-sub-title">For further improvement, I tried to expand to platforms with video background of the digital card, and push card info update request to each other that would be a clear future stage.</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-small">Besides, I pleased with the end-to-end result of this apps and fulfill social responsibility with an eco concept - Save the Earth! :)</p>
