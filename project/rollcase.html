I tested with two participants that help me understand the user and how they interacting with the app:</p>

Participants said completion step a bit longer. So, I streamlined the step from four to three step and some interaction element issues.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">In terms of the scan card processing, Above is another example; testing showed users were unsure whether the correct part of the card shot was selected and edit after; Following its implementation, however, users were overlooking and missing the contact data beneath it. In the high-fidelity version, a card preview was added accordingly. So the card preview became more clearly for thier editing if data extract not correctly.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-large">After a few rounds of hand drafts iterating to figure out which is effective with user. Revised step-based framework is much cleaner and more straightforward, interacted with it and completed the task successfully which allow me to figure out the final process.

        <p class="observable body spacing-small">In order to validate whether the pain points were solved and how helpful are the app. I conducted with 4 participants (who same people interviewed) testing the working prototype. Here are summative evaluation with target users:</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-small">This app is special to me because it was the first own UX project, which opened my eyes to the possibilities of using UX mindset as a solution which show me concrete experience.</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-small">Although the digital card app market is flooded with loads of apps that look the same, rollCase brings something different to the market. I pleased with the end result of this product. Besides product design, fulfill social responsibility with an eco-solution solution. Save our planet! :)</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-small">Expanding to new platforms with video background of the digital card and could be Chinese version would be a clear next step further. This would help user engaging experience and users get the better insights.</p>
