        <p class="observable body spacing-small">The truth is, most people haven't spend time to organize bussiness card immediately, and manually save business card details to their mobile or put into cardcase. It's sometimes easy to forget or lose it. They often waste time on card finding if they contact with someone.</p>

        <p class="observable h6 spacing-title txtpoint">#2 &nbsp;<b>Digital card app not common</b></p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-small">Across those research before, with 2/10 interviewees experience in app. but they were also simultaneously feels hard to use and feel vague to some users, so they dropping off. Typically, Users only if provides simple way or clear guide of task flow will interested in app use. This opens rooms for development for digital card app for potential markert, that i observed.</p>

        <p class="observable h6 spacing-title txtpoint">#3 &nbsp;<b>They don't worried about the environmental pollution issue</b></p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-large">In fact, There was a human-facing issue not only app usage or not so. For paper card user who can not make a business card instantly if someone information changed they had to order an entirely new stack of business cards. There's also extra pollution whenever the people lose the card and production of the card. In other words, fit is more important for paper card users than for current app user with ones.</p>

        <p class="observable h1 spacing-title statement-2">Step-oriented make the task easier and smoothly</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Task flow is an essential part of the app. Entire apps consist of three core feature: <b>Card Creation</b>, <b>Card Exhange</b> and <b>Paper Card Digitalize</b>. Aim to visually-fouced flow that helps for lessening users cognitive load and thier task completion intuitively. To do so, the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning new things. It also helps to heightens the motivation of both user types so that fits real-life usage.</p>
