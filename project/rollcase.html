Also, paper card user can not make a business card instantly if information changed they had to order an entirely new stack of business cards. There's also extra pollution whenever the people reprint or lose the card. In other words, fit is more important for paper card users than for current app user with ones.</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-sub-title">For further improvement, I tried to expand feature to the platforms: 1. Contact profile with video background of the digital card, 2. Push card info update request to each other. 3. Allow share company brochure and intro video that would be a clear future stage.</p>

        <!--<p class="observable body spacing-sub-title">***rollcase further feature Phase 2 Share company brochure and intro video (detail page icon shows what your partner imported)***</p>-->
