    <p class="observable body spacing-sub-title">Being the limited resources as only UX/UI designer on the project. This
      app is special to me because it was first own UX project. Although there are not involved business goals, which
      opened my eyes to the possibilities of using UX mindset as a solution. Figuring out the users logic and purpose a
      huge part before jumping into the design, and in the real world there are many more things to consider and
      validate that i believe.<!--Although without in-depth user research that further research for validation. --></p>

    <p class="observable body spacing-sub-title">For further improvement, I tried to expand feature to the platforms: 1.
      Contact profile with video background of the digital card, 2. Allow share company brochure and intro video that
      would be a clear future stage.</p>

    <!--<p class="observable body spacing-sub-title">***rollcase further feature Phase 2 Share company brochure and intro video (detail page icon shows what your partner imported)***</p>-->

      social responsibility with an eco concept - Save the Earth! :)</p>
