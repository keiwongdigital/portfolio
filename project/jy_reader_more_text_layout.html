      <p class="observable body spacing-small">First off, I conducted interviews with 8 people who active and infrequent e-Reader and printed version as well by What's App. To understanding they faced problem and their behavior patterns of how they use e-Book reader.

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title spacing-small">Define and Ideate</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">At this stage, referring to feedback from research, the pain points have become visible and the needs can be identified and basic for design process phase.</p>
      <p class="observable body">Here are summarized the Needs below:</p>
      <ul class="observable body spacing-small">
          <li>Usability - <b>Uncomfortable for long time reading on mobile devices</b></li>
          <li>Functionality - <b>Incomplete reader feature, as well as read progress tracking, history and offline reading.</b></li>
          <li>Visual Appeal - <b>UI was simple and outdated not pleasing, can not attractive to readers</b></li>
          <li>Book Genres - <b>Not provided any Jin-Yong's book almost 90% existing app</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Almost 75% of people said: <b>"Hard reading on mobile screens"</b> that clearly mentioned. This most obvious comment of mobile reading. Sum up that result of usability of platform as important issues for user experenice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="copy-width spacing-medium">
      <p class="observable h3 spacing-title spacing-medium"><b>Challenge</b></p>
      <p class="observable h1 body spacing-small jy-color">How can I bring reader to experience Jin-Yongs novels digitally and feel comfortable and satisfied as well?</p>
      <p class="observable body txtpoint">Usability of platform</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Normally, A novels with much pages and words, such as most popular "射鵰英雄傳" with 1.2 million words. It will take you much longer to finish the novel. During the reading, giving comfortable and enjoyable experience as important even health concerns issues. With that in mind, tablet larger screen has optimal of usability and experience for novels reader. Although mobile used widely. Especially, Reading on an tablet feels natural and comfortable much easier on the eyes (Landscape orientation almost same as physical hard-copy size).</p>

      <p class="observable body"><b>Book genres</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Create category of "About Jin-Yong’s", “Jin studies” related, as well as his novels research book that expand audience reach and increase sales value</p>

      <p class="observable body"><b>Attrative of UI</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Create main visual of the novel contain the whole stage belongs to Jin-Yong's, Legends, History, Martial arts elements it would be improve ambience of Jin-Yong-themed bookstore</p>

      <p class="observable body"><b>Enhance In-App feature</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Notification or reminder that inform to users as long period of time non-reading status. Contain last reading tracking and chapter info. Instanly download for offline reading after validated the purchase</p>

      <p class="observable body"><b>Content Marketing</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Well-known Characters/Heroes and Martial arts are main factor of the Jin-Yong novels. Create interesting content makes bookstore more attractive and user engagement greatly.</p>

      <p class="observable body">Once I had determined the focus scope of the product and uncovered some design challenges and goals to keep in mind, I sketch out my ideas and built a flow diagram of the entire app that will help us to quickly brainstorm ideas together and intial testing.

      <p class="observable body">After I got the revisions with teamates. I sketch out my ideas to better visualize the solution. After that, I started with wireframes phase, we focused on how to design a service that is more simple and intuitive experience. In the users persona part, the most need of the easier to use and more understandable interface. So, I tested the wireframes with 3 interviewees to understand which they preferred, extracting information, and visual appeal. This guided how I designed the rest of the experience. Here are prototyping screens, states and internal interection of core features.</p>

      <p class="observable h3 spacing-title"><b>Visual</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">I decided three keywords for rollCase entire visual apperenance of the app: <b>Realistic, Stylish and Professional</b>.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">The app is image-driven including a lot of digital cards and users avatars. Use dark background makes the digital cards visuals deeper and makes the content highly legible with the orange accent color. To improve user experience, usage huge set of icon can help users navigate and operate the app clearly and quickly. In the type color, I used white for the text and and included a great deal of grey description to give a calm and clean appearance.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Additionally, I hope take that for a good balance of usability and visual appeal. Design approaches varous engaging illustration elements to keep it fun while working.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">In Actually, Designing interaction as vertical scrolling which like real cardcase used the same notion here. The Bottom of navigation bars as core feature section, used frosted glass effect that incorporating static card and dynamic visuals, when scrolling where card are still blurred behind another, its more catchy. The quick filter panel allows a user to sort out they wanted, such as recent contact, favorites, company, group etc.</p>
