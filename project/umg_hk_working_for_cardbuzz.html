I learnt the role visual design plays in reflecting the mission and values of a music production brand. It’s extremely important to strike a balance between brand image and actual visual design. Both are equally important when you’re designing for a user.<br><br>Also, I realizing how to best prepare the assets, design elements and system so that the teammate could understand easily, reducing the amount of time for back-and-forth communication and adjustment.<br><br>The whole experiencing opened my eyes to the difficulties and joys of creating digital products.</p>
