It is so important to spend time developing the visual design aesthetics. As a designer, it's not just screen design, viewing the product with the holistic view from various angles has been a great help that it represent what the brand stood for and what it wanted to project to its customers.<br><br>Another key takeaway from working on this project was realizing how to best prepare the assets, design elements and system so that the teammate could understand easily and systematically, reducing the amount of time for back-and-forth communication and adjustment.<br><br>The whole experiencing opened my eyes to the difficulties and joys of creating digital products.</p>
