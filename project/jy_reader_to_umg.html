      <p class="observable body h1 spacing-title">Develop the Themed-Bookstore</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small txtpoint">During the discovery phase which inspired me to create a themed bookstore. With that in mind, I determined to transform the e-book reader into a Jin-Yong's theme bookstore where through reconstructe the whole experience and gain value as well. During user research phase, I identified that the approach of themed bookstore was aligning well with the acheive users goals concurrently. Hoping that it helps to fit reading into thier lives. Moreover, which able to bring the wide range of printed potential audience to the digital. Here are some insights:</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Reading status tracking as key desirable functions during the user research. Lets help the users meets thier reading behaviour or unexpected cause stoped reading. It’s been studied that being able to track progress is a great source of motivation. Seeing only a page number can be demotivating. Making it possible to keeping track of an increasing percentage makes even the thickest of novels more friendly; Let's users feel like achieving something each reading. This is especially to achieve goals who want to manage time effectively and multitasks users as well. They trend to spend time with the personal things mostly.</p>

      <p class="observable h2 spacing-title">UI DESIGN</p>
      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Visual Language</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">One consistent of feedback from former users and avid users, and across both interviews and testing, is that Jin-Yong's reader existing visual design is dated and aesthetically unappealing. Due to this, I decided that creating a uniqueness visual identity and more intuitive user experience as well.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Visual whole stage belongs to Jin-Yong's novels element. I outlined 3 keywords: <em><strong>"Legends", "History" and "Martial arts"</strong></em>. These are necessary elements of the novels.</p>
      <p class="observable body">The overall UI design is simple with light yellow as background colors while wine red as accent colors. Since the pages are going to be filled with many book covers (that has so many colors) it is ideal to keep the app colors as minimal as possible.  I've also customize four set of book mockup and a unique vector calligraphy element as well. It should make the message and interactions easier and clearer.

          <p class="observable body spacing-small">Participants has responded overall the experience has a higher success rate and satisfaction rate by the bookstore approach rather than ebook readers.

        <p class="observable body spacing-point">#1 "Reading Reminder", which is placed set the date and time to get a reminder to read the novels. Hopefully this way, users will not to be forgotten when they are busy.</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-point">#2 In the reading mode that contains features the user can use to log their thoughts and memorable quotes from the novels.</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-small">Looking back on the whole process, I feel like I learned a lot during the process. I hope I have enhanced myself in learning the broad spectrum of UX design from the ground up, based in research and user needs, and create an original design to help Jin-Yong's novels lovers keep their reading.</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-small">A challenge for me to start a personal project, and to see it through to the end, However, this was an opportunity to do something for its and my own sake; to fully explore my own sense of creativity and passion for design.</p>
