      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title spacing-small">Research</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Here, I did an app audit to analyze and understand the ebook reader app overall navigation, features and its usabilities as well. Throughout this process, I was able to identify some clear usability issues and pain points. Thus, in order to validate these observations, I needed to perform some user interviews and testings and try to get their thoughts.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">First off, I conducted interviews adnd testing the app with 8 people (who active, infrequent e-Reader and printed version as well) by What's App. To understanding they faced problem and behavior patterns.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-title">Then, I assigned some simple tasks to see how they would personally use it:</p>
      <p class="observable body txtpoint spacing-small" span style="line-height: 38px;">
          1) Navigation around App<br>
          2) In-App Reading on difference scenes: Home / Public transit<br>
          3) Time Spend<br>
          4) Check your reading status and history
      </p>
      <p class="observable body">After through affinity mapping quickly, I attempted to further group the problem to come up for most pain points and emotional feels. Here are summarized user quotes at below:</p>

Lets help the users meets thier reading behaviour or unexpected cause stoped reading. It’s been studied that being able to track progress is a great source of motivation. Seeing only a page number can be demotivating. Making it possible to keeping track of an increasing percentage makes even the thickest of novels more friendly; Let's users feel like achieving something each reading.

Create new book category where the user can find "About Jin-Yong’s", “Jin studies” and novels research book etc. That would be expand audience reach and driven the purchase. In additional, Create value-added content that about the well-known characters and martial arts which are main element of the Jin-Yong novels that resonate with target audiences and help them find the information they’re looking for.

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">One consistent of feedback from former users and avid users, and across both interviews and testing, is that Jin-Yong's reader existing visual design is dated and aesthetically unappealing. Due to this, I decided that creating a uniqueness visual identity and more intuitive user experience as well.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Visual whole stage belongs to Jin-Yong's novels element. I outlined 3 keywords: <em><strong>"Legends", "History" and "Martial arts"</strong></em>. These are necessary elements of the novels.</p>
      <p class="observable body">The overall UI design is simple with light yellow as background colors while wine red as accent colors. Since the pages are going to be filled with many book covers (that has so many colors) it is ideal to keep the app colors as minimal as possible.  I've also customize four set of book mockup and a unique vector calligraphy element as well. It should make the message and interactions easier and clearer.

For this purpose, i created martial arts and storyline novels illustration as innovative visual elements and consistent with the whole UI.

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">A new design of the bookstore home page which focuses on clarity and categorizes content to improve visual hierarchy. In addtional, I separated the book genres into three category where ‘細讀巨匠’ (Novels collection), ‘江湖以外 (Reference book)’ and ‘論盡金學’ (Research book) with horizontal-scrolling for better discovery. The rest of the page is reserved for specific offer and popular books and etc. Makes it easier for users to find the books they want to read and elevated the content as well.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">A option that is particularly by long time reading. The "Eye protect mode" that provide the best legibility reduce visual stress for reading on long period. This color scheme as previously mentioned.

        <p class="observable h1 spacing-title txtpoint">Usability Testing</p>
      </div>
      <div class="copy-width-large-col-copy-r-copy">
        <p class="observable body spacing-medium">To validate the design was really fulfils the needs of users. I conducted some usability tests with 4 participants testing the hi fidelity prototype of the app. There are the tasks that they need to do which allowed me to validate the core functionality and MVP of the app and gathered feedback.</p>

          <p class="observable body spacing-small txtpoint">Task 1: Navigating whole app and usage</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-copy h2">TASK COMPLETION RATE:</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-point highlight">80%</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Result: "Nice interface, Easy way to use and smooth; It's really catchy novels grahics get my attention!; Interesting, I like Kung-Fu section with knowledge"</p>

          <p class="observable body spacing-small txtpoint">Task 2: Keep tracking of reading status</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-copy h2">TASK COMPLETION RATE:</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-point highlight">85%</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Result: "There is clearly infomation, I could keep track my status, make me aware use of time and effort when i was reading."</p>

          <p class="observable body spacing-small txtpoint">Task 3: Discover book by genres</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-copy h2">TASK COMPLETION RATE:</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-point highlight">90%</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Result: "Convenience, all in one place i needed; It's very handy, Let me find about jin-yong's reference book easily."</p>

          <p class="observable body spacing-small txtpoint">Task 4: In-App Reading</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-copy h4">TASK COMPLETION RATE:</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-point highlight">80%</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-large">Result: "This app suits reading really well, I think I’ll use tablet reading further; Eye-protect mode was helful for me, i felt smooth on reading"</p>

          <p class="observable body spacing-small">Participants respond positively with overall the experience has a higher success rate and satisfaction rate. But still have several feedbacks for the app that I think will be useful if I develop it a little bit more to improve the design to the final step.</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-medium">I still came to be aware of some insights like some users reported high saturated color on the home screen annoying so I made changes accordingly and some other feedback.</p>

    </div>


    <div class="copy-width spacing-medium">
      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title txtpoint">Iterations</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Thus, on the second iteration, I’ve made the icons on search page to be clickable. It will direct users to list of popular subject based on what icon they selected before.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="copy-width spacing-large">
        <p class="observable h1 spacing-title txtpoint">Takeaway</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-small">The own project presented me with the opportunity to design an app from the ground up, based in research and user needs, and create an original design to help Jin-Yong's novels lovers keep their reading.</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-copy">FUTURE WORK</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-small">Because of the limited time and resources I wasn’t able to test the final product as much as I wanted to. I participated in a series of internal QA sessions to ensure the quality of the product, but I would’ve liked to conduct more usability testing with actual users, receive feedback and iterate if there was more time.</p>
