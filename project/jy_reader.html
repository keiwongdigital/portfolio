      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Role</p>
      <p class="observable body">This was an individual project. Though I am not in the publishing business, I did however like the idea of re-designing Jin-Yong novels e-reader. I take full of the roles involved in designing a product UX and UI.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="copy-width spacing-medium">
      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title spacing-small">Research</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Here, I did an app audit to analyze and understand the ebook reader app overall navigation, features and its usabilities as well. Throughout this process, I was able to identify some clear usability issues and pain points. Thus, in order to validate these observations, I needed to perform some user interviews and testings and try to get their thoughts.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">First off, I conducted interviews adnd testing the app with 8 people (who active, infrequent e-Reader and printed version as well) by What's App. To understanding they faced problem and behavior patterns.</p>

      <p class="observable body">Then, I assigned some simple tasks to see how they would personally use it:</p>
      <ul class="observable body spacing-small" style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0px;">
          <li class="txtpoint">1) Navigation around App</li>
          <li class="txtpoint">2) In-App Reading diff scenes: Home / Public transit</li>
          <li class="txtpoint">3) Time Spend</li>
          <li class="txtpoint">4) Check your reading status and history</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="observable body">After through affinity mapping quickly, I attempted to further group the problem to come up for most pain points and emotional feels. Here are summarized user quotes at below:</p>

          <li><b>Reading platform</b><br>Uncomfortable reading on limited screen of mobile that most obvious comment of printed users. 5 people who said reads at MTR has interference and shoulder pain. 1 people who said Amazon Kindle with better devices for reading.</li>
          <li><b>Lack of book genres</b><br>3/8 of them said that not provided of Jin-Yong's and relevant novels products and interesting content.</li>
          <li><b>Simple and outdated UI</b><br>6/8 of them said that boring layout and unappealing, especially avid readers mentioned "It's not catching for me".</li>

    <div class="copy-width spacing-medium">
      <p class="observable body txtpoint">Key Takeaways:</p>
      <ul class="observable body spacing-medium" style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0px;">
          <li><b>PROBLEM #1</b> - Every readers has a own personalized reading habits. No having a tracking features caused problems of lower thier reading efficiency and flexibility which most mentioned. Thus, users desire a traceable information and history what current reading, and how long to time spend in reading.</li>
          <li><b>PROBLEM #2</b> - Long period on mobile screen cause thier uncomfortable and concern health issue as well. Avid readers has "Enjoy" novels extremly and spend 2.5+ hour average. Thus, users desire to better enviorment and devices to read more fluently. It ended up why trend to printed version.</li>
          <li><b>PROBLEM #3</b> - They perfered to discover novels storyline and martial arts book after they have read novels. There is no specific relevant or book they wanted. Thus, They trend to search on goolge.</li>
          <li><b>PROBLEM #4</b> - Interface and visual design that can not get users interested. Jin Yong's is legends of martial arts novel. Some of avid readers expressed their love for his works.  Lack of novels element had made thier disappointed.</li>

      <p class="observable body h1 spacing-title">Develop the Themed-Bookstore</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small txtpoint">During the discovery phase which inspired me to create a themed bookstore. With that in mind, I determined to transform the e-book reader into a Jin-Yong's theme bookstore where through reconstructe the whole experience and gain value as well. During user research phase, I identified that the approach of themed bookstore was aligning well with the acheive users goals concurrently. Hoping that it helps to fit reading into thier lives. Moreover, which able to bring the wide range of printed potential audience to the digital.</p>

      <p class="observable body"><b>#1 Enhance In-App reader feature</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Reading status tracking as key desirable functions during the user research. Lets help the users meets thier reading behaviour or unexpected cause stoped reading. It’s been studied that being able to track progress is a great source of motivation. Seeing only a page number can be demotivating. Keeping track of an increasing percentage makes even the thickest of novels more approachable; Let users feel like achieving something each reading. This is especially to achieve goals who want to manage time effectively and multitasks users as well. They trend to spend time with the personal things mostly.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">In order to improve the reading experience and make it more personal and customizable, I created a "Protect" mode and "Reading in-printed" theme which are users reads comfortably on long period and feel like "Real" emotional needs as well.</p>

      <p class="observable body"><b>#2 Customised book by genres</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">New category where the user can find "About Jin-Yong’s", “Jin studies” and novels research book etc other than novels.That would be expand audience reach and driven the purchase.</p>

      <p class="observable body"><b>#3 Value-added content</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Interactive section that about the well-known characters and martial arts which are main element of the Jin-Yong novels. This makes the bookstore more attractive and user engagement greatly.</p>


      <p class="observable body"><b>#4 Consistency with visual designs</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Visual whole stage belongs to Jin-Yong's novels element. I outlined 3 keywords: Legends, History and Martial arts. These are necessary elements of the novels taht it would be improve ambience of Jin-Yong-themed bookstore.</p>

    <div class="copy-width spacing-medium">
      <p class="observable h1 body spacing-small jy-color">"How might I bring readers to experience Jin-Yongs novels comfortable and efficient as well?"</p>
      <p class="observable body h1 spacing-title">Usability of platform</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Normally, The novels with a ton of words and much pages, such as most popular "射鵰英雄傳" with 1.2 million words. It will take you much longer to finish the novel.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Discovery users needs and observation of real life situations during the user feedback. I intend to design with a "Tablet-first" approach that bring the user optimal of usability, comfortable experience and health issues is important as well. The tablet scale screen not only lowers abandonment rates, but can also concentrate on reading. Landscape orientation almost same as physical hard-copy size.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Although mobile used widely, but single-handed opreate that not ideal for long time reading, especially a ton of words novels. It was inefficient and time-consuming. User needs frequently action of scrolling swipe down or swipe left during reading process.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">The app is image-driven including a lot of digital cards and users avatars. Use dark background makes the digital cards visuals deeper and makes the content highly legible with the orange accent color. To improve user experience, usage huge set of icon can help users navigate and operate the app clearly and quickly. In the type color, I used white for the text and and included a great deal of grey description to give a calm and clean appearance.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Additionally, I hope take that for a good balance of usability and visual appeal. Design approaches varous engaging illustration elements to keep it fun while working.</p>
