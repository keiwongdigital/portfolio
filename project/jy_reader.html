      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Visual whole stage belongs to Jin-Yong's novels element. I outlined 2 keywords: "Originality" and "Iconic". These are necessary elements of the novels, which ideating to design App logo also.</p>

      <p class="observable body">The overall UI design is simple and emotional to establish a connection. Since the pages are going to be filled with many book covers, it is ideal to keep the app colors as minimal as possible. A light bit yellow as background colors while wine red as accent colors. Besides, I've also customize four set of book mockup and a unique vector calligraphy element as well. It make the message and interactions clealy.</p>
