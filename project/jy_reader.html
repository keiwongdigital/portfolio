        <p class="observable body spacing-small">This project an MVP solution, I looking back on the whole project was very fun, challenging. I hope Jin-Yong's Theme-bookstore novel app that brings something different to the market. This project forced me to try a bold solution for Jin-Yong's works. I feel it allowed me to push my creativity and passion for design. Believes that would be no boundaries between users and their reading experiences.</p>
