      <p class="observable body spacing-title"><b>INSIGHTS :</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-title">Most people who trend to multi-task nowadays, it's reasonable to assum that readers would want to do other activities like playing games or somewhat on social media while reading. Just a page number bookmarking option can be demotivating thier reading efficiency. So, They valued a tracable of detail what is reads on. Below are the key findings arcoss the research before :</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-copy"><b>WHY :</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Jin Yong's novels is a text-heavy fiction. Novel readers would not be rush to reading, because it isn't online article or news. Typically, Mobile not suitable for long-form novel reads. Would not solve the problem even users enlarge font size because mobile screen size was fixed, only causing more scrolling frequently.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-copy"><b>INSIGHTS :</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-sub-title">Tablet landscape screen almost same as hard-copy size that well-adapted Z-pattern for human reading. Across those interviewed, they preferred to reading novels with hard-copy and kindle at most, and would like to stay home reading, it keep maintain motivation during long period reading. That’s why tablet trend to student reading. Of course, that could be loss mobile user base engaging.</p>  <!--But there’s no such thing as a perfect App or Devices. hats why tablet trend to use for student learning-->
