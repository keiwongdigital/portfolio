        <p class="observable body spacing-small">This was an individual own project. Though I am not in the publishing field, I did however like the idea of re-designing Jin-Yong novels e-reader. I take full of the roles involved in designing a product UX and UI.</p>

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title spacing-small">Research</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Kicking off the project, I did an app audit to analyze and understand the ebook reader app overall navigation, features and its usabilities as well. Throughout this process, I was able to identify some clear usability issues and pain points. Thus, in order to validate these observations, I needed to perform some user interviews and testings and try to get their thoughts.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">First, I conducted interviews and testing the app with 8 people (who active, infrequent e-Reader and printed version as well) by What's App. To understanding they faced problem and behavior patterns.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-title">Then, I assigned some simple tasks to see how they would personally use it:</p>
      <p class="observable body txtpoint spacing-small" span style="line-height: 38px;">
          Task 1 : Navigating entire App<br>
          Task 2 : In-App Reading on difference scenes: Home / Public transit<br>
          Task 3 : Time Spend<br>
          Task 4 : Check reading status and history
      </p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">After through affinity mapping quickly, I attempted to further group the problem to come up for most pain points and emotional feels. Here are summarized user quotes at below:</p>

Lets help the users meets thier reading behaviour or unexpected cause stoped reading. It‚Äôs been studied that being able to track progress is a great source of motivation. Seeing only a page number can be demotivating. Making it possible to keeping track of an increasing percentage makes even the thickest of novels more friendly; Let's users feel like achieving something each reading.

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Discovery users needs and observation of real life situations during the user feedback. I intend to design with a "Tablet-first" approach that bring the user optimal of usability and comfortable experience, eye risk health issues is important as well. The tablet scale screen not only lowers abandonment rates, but can also concentrate on reading. Landscape orientation almost same as physical hard-copy size to meet user needs.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Although mobile used widely, Base on result as above, single-handed opreate that not ideal for long time reading, especially a ton of words novels. It was inefficient and time-consuming. User needs frequently action of scrolling swipe down or swipe left during reading process that decrease motivation and anticipation for users using the app.</p>

      <p class="observable body h1 spacing-title">Optimeize reader color scheme</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">The reason is because most participants I interviewed said that when reads long time mostly feels eye strain. So, I decided to find solution color scheme how to reduce visual stress and the best legibility.</p>
      
      <p class="observable body spacing-large">The color scheme according to <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/pubs/pdfs/2017/colors.pdf" target="_blank" class="observable underlined" href="">"Luz Rello </a>- Bigham Human-Computer Interaction Institute & Carnegie Mellon University" & <a href="https://www.viget.com/articles/color-contrast/" target="_blank" class="observable underlined" href="">"Tom Osborne</a> - VP, Design" which base on research for long time reading period. Firstly, I ensure text contrasts with its background in both hue and value should be a minimum of about 80% percent and balance RGB color approach that provides natural contrast and, optimal readability and comfortable for body text.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">One consistent of feedback from former and avid users, and across both interviews and testing, is that Jin-Yong's novels reader existing visual design is dated and aesthetically unappealing. Due to this, I decided that creating a uniqueness visual identity and more intuitive user experience as well.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Visual whole stage belongs to Jin-Yong's novels element. I outlined 3 keywords: "Legends", "History" and "Martial arts". These are necessary elements of the novels.</p>

      <p class="observable body">The overall UI design is simple and emotional to establish a connection. Since the pages are going to be filled with many book covers, it is ideal to keep the app colors as minimal as possible. A light bit yellow as background colors while wine red as accent colors. I've also customize four set of book mockup and a unique vector calligraphy element as well. It make the message and interactions clealy.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">This approach was completely providing a fresh viewpoint on landing experience. Infinite loop posterboard design, relevant section with spectacular illustration where user can tap on, which allows to keep people interested through the entire navigation.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-large">With new design of the bookstore page which categorized content to elevate visual hierarchy. I separated the three category of book where ‚ÄòÁ¥∞ËÆÄÂ∑®Âå†‚Äô (Novels collection), ‚ÄòÊ±üÊπñ‰ª•Â§ñ (Reference book)‚Äô and ‚ÄòË´ñÁõ°ÈáëÂ≠∏‚Äô (Research book) with horizontal scrolling.

      <p class="observable body">In "My Bookshelf" page allow the user can keep track of reading status easily that contain of currently, percentage of pages reads, last reading time and chapter/pages detail. No longer need to assume how much time it will take to reading. The app will evaluate a novels that take time for next time reading.

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Reinforces the In-App Reading experience</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">As prototyping shown, the Tablet-first approach was smoothly and comfortable reading with wide screen and the whole UI feel less cramped as well as better for eyes friendly experience, which is visually clean and legible. Base on result, The novels illustrations between the chapter was reserved that keep feel "Real" same as printed version.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Quick swiping button with detail info make it clearly what a page shown when users swiping. Moreover, user able to open user preference setting panel by top right button. There are variety of option which is customize option, such as font face, size, colors, night mode, page turn interactions and bookmarks with auto-saving the currently etc to suit users reading behavior.</p>

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Comfortably by Eye option</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">From there, The "Eye protect mode" provide the best legibility reduce visual stress for reading on long period that particularly for long time reading users. This color scheme as previously mentioned that value would be background color as #555F61 and gray font color as #333333, with a bit emboss natural paper texture. This combination of color scheme was give out a soft and natural  which has less of a stimulating effect on our eyes.</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-point">#1 "Reading Reminder", which is placed set the date and time to get a reminder to read the novels. Hopefully this way, users will not to be forgotten when they are busy.</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-point">#2 In the reading mode that contains features the user can use to log their thoughts and memorable quotes from the novels.</p>

        <p class="observable h1 spacing-title txtpoint">Takeaway</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-small">Looking back on the whole process, I feel like I learned a lot during the process. I hope I have enhanced myself in learning the broad spectrum of UX design. This project forced me to try a new bold look for Jin-Yong's works.
