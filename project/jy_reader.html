      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Hypothesis : Tablet-first as Reading Platform</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Jin Yong's novels is a text-heavy fiction. Novel readers would not be rush to reading, because it isn't online article or news. Mobile not suitable for long period reading. Would not solve the problem even users enlarge font size because mobile screen size was fixed, causing more horizontal scrolling frequently also.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-title">A tablet landscape screen almost same as physical hard-copy size that well-adapted Z-pattern people reading. It is crucial to make them comfortable and fluently when reading on wide screen, and especially a ton of words novels. Across those interviewed, they preferred to reading novels with printed version at most, and would typically rather reading them at home. Of course, that could be loss mobile user base engaging.
