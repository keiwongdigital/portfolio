Then, in order to validate these observations, I needed to perform some user interviews and experience with e-Reader. and try to get their thoughts. I conducted interviews about the app with 8 people (who reads digitally and printed version) using Facebook group vote poll. Plus, I assigned some simple tasks to see how they would personally use it and reading behavior patterns.</p>

      <p class="observable body h1 spacing-title">Developing the Themed-Bookstore</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">During the discovery phase which inspired me to create a themed bookstore. With that in mind, I determined to transform the e-book reader app came up to a Jin-Yong's theme bookstore where through reconstructe the whole experience and gain value as well. During the result of user research phase, I identified that the approach of themed bookstore was aligning well with the acheive users goals concurrently. This approach giving readers multiple levels of imagery and feelings to enhance the reading experience and align with avid readers needs.</p>

          <li class="spacing-sub-title"><span class="h6">Provide more Book genre and Value-added content</span><br>
          By adding book genre which Jin-Yong, such as “Jin Studies (金學)” and novels research book to expand audience reach. Additionaly, By creating interactive value-added content that about the well-known characters and martial arts which are main element of the Jin-Yong novels, that resonate with target audiences expectation.

    <div class="copy-width spacing-medium">
      <p class="observable body h1 spacing-title">Enhance Utility of in-App Reader</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Reading status tracking is functions they desire for during the user research. This is key to help the users meets thier reading behaviour or unexpected cause stoped reading. It’s been studied that being able to track progress is a great source of motivation. Seeing only a page number can be demotivating. By showing percentage that ease way understand rather than page number, Also, evaluate a novels that take time for next time reading also to reduce user stress. Makes it even the thickest of novels more friendly; This is especially to achieve goals who want to manage time effectively and multitasks users as well. They trend to spend time with the personal things mostly.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Plus, Interviewees mentioned that when reads long time mostly feels eye strain. So, I decided to find color scheme for suitable reading how to reduce body text visual stress and the best legibility.</p>

    <div class="copy-width spacing-large">
      <p class="observable body h1 spacing-title">Reading Platform Strategy</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Suitable devices is one of key they are looking for. According to users real life situations, Read novels in home as most usage scenarios and motivations. I intend to design with a "Tablet-first" approach where landscape screen almost same as physical hard-copy size to bring the user optimal of utility and comfortable reading experience. The tablet scale screen not only lowers abandonment rates and eye health issues, but can also concentrate on reading. Below are the picked data that supports the "Tablet-first" approach:</p>

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Design System</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">One consistent of feedback from former and avid users, and across both interviews and testing, is that Jin-Yong's novels reader existing visual design is dated and aesthetically unappealing. Due to this, I decided that creating a uniqueness visual identity and more intuitive user experience as well.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Visual whole stage belongs to Jin-Yong's novels element. I outlined 3 keywords: "Legends", "History" and "Martial arts". These are necessary elements of the novels, which ideating to design App logo also.</p>

      <p class="observable body">The overall UI design is simple and emotional to establish a connection. Since the pages are going to be filled with many book covers, it is ideal to keep the app colors as minimal as possible. A light bit yellow as background colors while wine red as accent colors. I've also customize four set of book mockup and a unique vector calligraphy element as well. It make the message and interactions clealy.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-large">With bookstore page which categorized content where sperated into the three category of book, ‘細讀巨匠’ as Novels collections, ‘江湖以外’ as Reference book and ‘論盡金學’ as Research book with horizontal scrolling  for groups of book views. A rest of the page is reserved for specific offer and popular books banner etc.</p>

No longer need to assume how much time it will take to reading. The app will evaluate a novels that take time for next time reading.

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Reinforces the In-App Reading experience</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">As prototyping shown, the Tablet-first approach was smoothly and comfortable reading with wide screen and the whole UI feel less cramped as well as better for eyes friendly experience, which is visually clean and legible. The novels illustrations between the chapter was reserved that keep feel "Real" same as printed version.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Quick swiping button with detail info make it clearly what a page shown when users swiping. Moreover, user able to open user preference setting panel by top right button. There are variety of option which is customize option, such as font face, size, colors, night mode, page turn interactions and bookmarks with auto-saving the currently etc to suit users reading behavior.</p>

      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Suitable option help for reading long period</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">The "Eye protect mode" as new color scheme. A background color value as #555F61 and gray font as #333, with a bit emboss paper texture same as printed version. This combination of color scheme was give out a soft and natural which has less of a stimulating effect on our eyes. That provides natural contrast, optimal readability and comfortable for body text.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="copy-width-large-col-copy-r-copy">
        <p class="observable body spacing-small">To validate the design was really fulfils the needs of users. I conducted some usability tests with 4 participants (who same people interviewed) testing the working prototype. There are the tasks that they need to do which allowed me to validate the core feature and gathering feedback.</p>

          <p class="observable body spacing-point txtpoint">Task 1: Overall Usability of the Bookstore</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-copy h4" style="color:#999999">TASK COMPLETION RATE:</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-point highlight">80%</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Result: "Easy way to use and smooth; It's really catchy novels grahics get my attention!; Interesting, I like Kung-Fu section with detail info"; "It's very handy, just in one place found i interested; "Nice interface"</p>

          <p class="observable body spacing-point txtpoint">Task 2: User Reading Activity</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-copy h4" style="color:#999999">TASK COMPLETION RATE:</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-point highlight">85%</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Result: "There is clearly infomation, I could keep track my status and history, make me aware use of time and effort when i was reading." "Nice, It also calculates the reading time"</p>

          <p class="observable body spacing-point txtpoint">Task 3: In-App Reader</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-copy h4" style="color:#999999">TASK COMPLETION RATE:</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-point highlight">78%</p>
          <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Result: "This app suits reading really well, I think I’ll use tablet reading further; Eye-protect mode was helful for me, i felt smooth on reading"</p>


          <p class="observable body spacing-small">Participants has responded has a positive feedback and satisfaction rate by the bookstore approach compare with ebook readers. In terms of the in-App Reader, Reading on Tablet reader can be really fullfilling their reading behaviors and expectations. Of course, that could be loss mobile user base engaging. But there’s no such thing as a perfect design/devices. However, would have great conversion rate in place i noted.</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-point">Finally, Here are a some things I could improve on.</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-point">#1 - "Reading Reminder", which is placed set the date and time to get a reminder to read the novels. Hopefully this way, users will not to be forgotten when they are busy.</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-point">#2 - In the reading mode that contains features the user can use to log their thoughts and memorable quotes from the novels.</p>

        <p class="observable h1 spacing-title txtpoint">Takeaway</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-small">Looking back on the whole project was simultaneously fun, challenging and enjoying. I feel like I learned a lot during the process. I hope I have enhanced myself in learning the broad spectrum of UX design. This project forced me to try a bold solution for Jin-Yong's works. I feel it allowed me to push my creativity and passion for design. Believes that would be no boundaries between users and their reading experiences.</p>
