      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title spacing-small">Research</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Here, I did an app audit to analyze and understand the ebook reader app overall navigation, features and its usabilities as well. Throughout this process, I was able to identify some clear usability issues and pain points. Thus, in order to validate these observations, I needed to perform some user interviews and testings and try to get their thoughts.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">First off, I conducted interviews adnd testing the app with 8 people (who active, infrequent e-Reader and printed version as well) by What's App. To understanding they faced problem and behavior patterns.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-title">Then, I assigned some simple tasks to see how they would personally use it:</p>
      <p class="observable body txtpoint spacing-small">
          1) Navigation around App<br>
          2) In-App Reading diff scenes: Home / Public transit<br>
          3) Time Spend<br>
          4) Check your reading status and history
      </p>
      <p class="observable body">After through affinity mapping quickly, I attempted to further group the problem to come up for most pain points and emotional feels. Here are summarized user quotes at below:</p>

          <li><b>PROBLEM #1</b> - Every readers has a own personalized reading habits. No having a tracking features caused problems of lower thier reading efficiency and flexibility which most mentioned. Thus, users desire a traceable information and history what current reading, and how long to time spend in reading.</li>
          <li><b>PROBLEM #2</b> - Long period on mobile screen cause thier uncomfortable and concern health issue as well. Avid readers has "Enjoy" novels extremly and spend 2.5+ hour average. Thus, users desire to better enviorment and devices to read more fluently. It ended up why trend to printed version.</li>
          <li><b>PROBLEM #3</b> - They perfered to discover novels storyline and martial arts book after they have read novels. There is no specific relevant or book they wanted. Thus, They trend to search on goolge.</li>
          <li><b>PROBLEM #4</b> - Interface and visual design that can not get users interested. Jin Yong's is legends of martial arts novel. Some of avid readers expressed their love for his works.  Lack of novels element had made thier disappointed.</li>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small txtpoint">During the discovery phase which inspired me to create a themed bookstore. With that in mind, I determined to transform the e-book reader into a Jin-Yong's theme bookstore where through reconstructe the whole experience and gain value as well. During user research phase, I identified that the approach of themed bookstore was aligning well with the acheive users goals concurrently. Hoping that it helps to fit reading into thier lives. Moreover, which able to bring the wide range of printed potential audience to the digital.</p>

      <p class="observable body"><strong>#1 Enhance In-App reader feature</strong></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Reading status tracking as key desirable functions during the user research. Lets help the users meets thier reading behaviour or unexpected cause stoped reading. It’s been studied that being able to track progress is a great source of motivation. Seeing only a page number can be demotivating. Keeping track of an increasing percentage makes even the thickest of novels more approachable; Let users feel like achieving something each reading. This is especially to achieve goals who want to manage time effectively and multitasks users as well. They trend to spend time with the personal things mostly.</p>

      <p class="observable body"><b>#2 Create Engaging and Interactive Content</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">In order to tailor the value content to audiences needs and expectations. Create new book category where the user can find "About Jin-Yong’s", “Jin studies” and novels research book etc. That would be expand audience reach and driven the purchase. In additional, Create value-added content that about the well-known characters and martial arts which are main element of the Jin-Yong novels that resonate with target audiences and help them find the information they’re looking for. This makes the bookstore more attractive and user engagement greatly.</p>

      <p class="observable body"><b>#3 Novel illustrations integrated</b></p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">A good illustration amplifies the words, giving readers multiple levels of imagery and feelings to enhance the reading experience. So, if work well in UI design uniqueness and recognizability that it would be improve ambience of Jin-Yong-themed bookstore, align with physical printed users as well.</p>

      <p class="observable body h1 spacing-title">Usability of reading platform</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Normally, The novels with a ton of words and much pages, such as most popular "射鵰英雄傳" with 1.2 million words. It will take you much longer to finish the novel.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Discovery users needs and observation of real life situations during the user feedback. I intend to design with a "Tablet-first" approach that bring the user optimal of usability, comfortable experience and health issues is important as well. The tablet scale screen not only lowers abandonment rates, but can also concentrate on reading. Landscape orientation almost same as physical hard-copy size.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-medium">Although mobile used widely, but single-handed opreate that not ideal for long time reading, especially a ton of words novels. It was inefficient and time-consuming. User needs frequently action of scrolling swipe down or swipe left during reading process.</p>

      <p class="observable body h1 spacing-title">Optimeize reader color scheme</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">The reason is because most participants I interviewed said that when reads long time mostly feels eye strain. So, I decided to find solution color scheme how to reduce visual stress and the best legibility.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">This approach of color scheme according to <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/pubs/pdfs/2017/colors.pdf" target="_blank" class="observable underlined" href="">"Luz Rello </a>- Bigham Human-Computer Interaction Institute & Carnegie Mellon University" & <a href="https://www.viget.com/articles/color-contrast/" target="_blank" class="observable underlined" href="">"Tom Osborne</a> - VP, Design" which base on research for long time reading period. Firstly, I needed ensure text contrasts with its background in both hue and value should be a minimum of about 80% percent and balance RGB color approach that provides natural contrast and, therefore, optimal readability and comfortable for body text.</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-large">I started initial idea sketching to see how we can solve these problems more easily with different ideas on a paper prototype.

      <p class="observable h2 spacing-title">HIGH FIDELITY DESIGN</p>
      <p class="observable h1 spacing-title">Visual Language</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">One consistent of feedback from former users and avid users, and across both interviews and testing, is that Jin-Yong's reader existing visual design is dated and aesthetically unappealing. Due to this, I decided that creating a uniqueness visual identity and more intuitive user experience as well.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Visual whole stage belongs to Jin-Yong's novels element. I outlined 3 keywords: <em><strong>"Legends", "History" and "Martial arts"</strong></em>. These are necessary elements of the novels.</p>
      <p class="observable body spacing-small">The overall UI design is simple with light yellow as background colors while wine red as accent colors. Since the pages are going to be filled with many book covers (that has so many colors) it is ideal to keep the app colors as minimal as possible.  I've also customize four set of book mockup and a unique vector calligraphy element as well. It should make the message and interactions easier and clearer.
