Also, it needs to communicate with its target audience in an approachable way. Through SINO brand principles and constraints, we created a visual language to enhance their form of hotel communication.

        2. Additionally, cities can be filtered through experiences (ref. to key insights):

        - nightlife<br>

        - stay and play<br>

        <p class="observable body spacing-small">The idea is simple: offering user products that support their travel experience while booking a hotel room. This feature will allow users to reserve a series of hotel facilities and services and pay for them beforehand.<br><br>

        The most important challenge in adding this feature is finding the right spot. Because the feature is just subsidiary and not mandatory, we need to put it on the phase where the user feels the most comfortable with — not too annoying but still serve its initial purpose: to sell.<br><br>


        After a long thinking process, we decided to put the phase after the user chooses the hotel and before the payment process. Since this step is not mandatory, users can opt to not click it and go straight to the payment process. Thus this covers both the conventional and unconventional users when booking a hotel room. For those who plan a lot, you can select additional airport transfer or book nearby activities, or for those who love impulsive buying, you can just decide later after you arrive at the destination.<br><br>

        Next step, what are the things that users might consider when buying add-ons. Multiple orders? Special request? or just as simple as looking at a bigger scale. We realise that most users will have concerns regarding buying additional products, that the ones who buy are the ones who plan. This type is the cautious type — details are everything to them.</p>

        <p class="observable copy spacing-large">Thus, we add little steps that will enhance user experience in buying add ons. On the first step, you can add the quantity of the add-ons that you would like to buy, plus adding notes to it. Then, if you want to know more about it, you can simply click on the image or the description, to see the detail. Adjusting quantity will be a matter of clicks, and to create a seamless and familiar experience, we adopted e-commerce behaviour and put it into this journey so users would naturally follow their instinct.</p>

        <p class="observable h1 spacing-sub-title">Booking page</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-small">The early designs provided flexibitity for modifications, but after the usability, I made notable updates. One important addition was incorporating a visual chart to indicate the users current position whitin the flow. This feature helped users better understand thier progress and navigte through the process more easily. Additionally, based on feedback, I replaced the button label"Select Bungalow with "Book Bungalow" since the selection had already been made. This change improved clarity and ensured that users had a more accurate representation of thier actions within the booking process.</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-small">The users preferred to see the price upfront before delving into the details. Talking this feedback into account, I make the necessary adjustments to prominently display the price the residence listing. This change enhanced transparency and allow users to make informed decisions without having to navigate to the details page first.</p>








        <p class="observable h1 spacing-sub-title">Consolidated Golf Holiday Listing Page</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-small">As Golf Holidays had a high priority, a specific page was created. All holiday packages available on the website are listed here and can be filtered.<br><br>

1. When coming from a particular country page,
the name of that country or city will already be auto-filled from the dropdown. This eliminated the need for multiple pages that were present on the old website.<br><br>

2. Quick inquiry for holiday packages. This is useful as many times the user base doesn’t have time to wish to spend time reading all the details. They can enter their email address and a consultant will get back to them with the details of the package</p>


        <p class="observable h1 spacing-sub-title">Clean Country Page</p>

        <p class="observable body spacing-small"></p>


        <p class="observable body spacing-small">1. For example, everyday weather at a country level isn’t required when already mentioned on the city page and the booking page. The whole country is unlikely to have the same weather.<br><br>

2. Organized the content. Displayed KPIs of the country along with icons so that the user gets an overview of the country.<br><br>

3. For easy access and to explore the cities in the specific country, went again for an interactive map style.<br><br>

4. Again, included Holiday packages - the main USP and what most users came for. Popular packages in the country are shown.</p>

Stakeholders can have valuable information regarding their users, details that we might not know. So it is important to ask for information from their side. <br><br>                                  
Figuring out the use cases plays a huge part before jumping into the design, ensuring that we don't miss any cases while designing.   <br><br>

      <p class="observable body">Since the pages are going to be filled with many book covers, it is ideal to keep the app colors as minimal as possible. Using light bit yellow as background colors like printed versions, Wine red as accent colors as Jin-Yong's seal color. Besides, I've also customize four set of book mockup and a unique vector calligraphy element as well.</p>
