      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Landing influence users perception of a UMG branding at first sight. Having two design goal was clear on the landing page: <b>1. Engage social media followers or subscribers, 2. Drive more sales to Ushop.com</b>. In order to capture audience attention faster when landed on. The final version was devised three sections only that immediately connect the message with the visuals as well as ensure easy discoverability.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Here, I designed a card-centric components as seem like "大字報" that clearly showcasing thier content, where consist of foucus published CD album, Artist's social feed and upcoming event. There are different styles with recognize tag of various content increasing content hierarchy and makes it easy to proceed to the next step of the users journey which will lead to a reduce bouncing rate also.<br><br>
      Having a full screen menu also helps in this aspect as it provides a clear overview of the website, providing easy access to the rest of the content.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Affiliate program was second goal of the project. As you see, once the user clicks on CTA button in Album Detail page. The affiliate tracking link puts a ID parameter redirect to Ushop.com (official e-shop) with unique ID number is used to track the sale back to website, when user purchase the CD Album.</p>

Meanwhile, the grid-based system with float being flex to both immediate and future website extending. <br><br>Redesigned the website was match well with the overall vibe in music branding. I utilized dark-gray themed while giving the website a highly desired, modern look, such as CD cover and campaign artwork etc. This would have been great with UMG that have the tremendous content images assets.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-large">In order to interact well with users, I created audio player widget to the website that getting people to click through and listen to a new single. When hovering, this area will show related CD album, and there will be a link to album detail page. Beside, As new section "UMG PRESS" is consist of official news and artist's social content where interchangeable navigation between the child page when user pulling down, to eliminate second level of the menu click-through.</p>
