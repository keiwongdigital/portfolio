It purpose to protect the user from getting stuck and keep on browsing, so that lead to a reduce bouncing rate also.</p>

      <p class="observable body spacing-small">We enrich the core content in second section that make it clear navigate and fast recognize at first glance for further discovey content. I utilized a masonry layout showcasing of various content that immediately connect the message with the visuals, where consist of focus CD album, artist's social feed and upcoming event etc connect to music audience directly. Beside, Having a full screen menu also helps in this aspect as it provides a clear overview of the website, easy access to the rest of the content. <span class="material-icons" style="font-size:15px; top: 2px; padding-right: 2px; padding-left: 2px;">open_in_new</span> <a class="image-popup-fit-width underlined" title="Click on image to enlarge/reduce it"  href="../images/projects/umg_hk/ui_grid.png">Detail</a></p>
