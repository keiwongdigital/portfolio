        <p class="observable body spacing-small">The project was very big and fun for me. As a designer, it's not just screen design. I learnt the role visual design plays in reflecting the mission and values of a music production brand. It’s extremely important to strike a balance between brand image and actual visual design.</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-small">The clients have a vision. But they don't always have the UX knowledge to understand users. Sometimes their requirements conflict with users needs. It's our designers' roles to help them empathize with users and bridge their vision with users' needs, and get on-board with a holistic design solution.</p>
        <p class="observable body spacing-large">In the future phase two of the project, we will also integrated UMG payment system  to better become ecommerce platform.</p>
